<ul>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">ETH currently trading at $3,929.46 with a 7.39% daily increase and 2.17% weekly gain</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Van de Poppe predicts bull run to continue into 2025 if ETH breaks $3,800 resistance</li>

<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Critical support level at $3,505 must hold to maintain bullish outlook</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ethereum&#8217;s price momentum continues to build as the leading smart contract platform approaches the psychologically important $4,000 level. <a href="https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/ethereum-news-eth-bull-run-to-resume-and-last-into-2025-michael-van-de-poppe-says/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum-news-eth-bull-run-to-resume-and-last-into-2025-michael-van-de-poppe-says">Trading data shows ETH has gained over 7% in the past 24 hours, reaching $3,929.46 as buyers step in at crucial support levels.</a></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The recent price action has caught the attention of veteran crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, who sees the current consolidation phase as a healthy pullback within a larger upward trend. According to van de Poppe, ETH&#8217;s ability to maintain support above $3,715 signals strong buyer interest at current levels.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical indicators paint an optimistic picture for Ethereum&#8217;s near-term prospects. The In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric reveals substantial buying activity clustering around the $3,715 price point, suggesting this level could serve as a springboard for future moves higher.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market data shows ETH has posted impressive gains over multiple timeframes, with a 7.39% increase over the past day and 2.17% growth over the week. This steady appreciation comes despite some resistance encountered near the $4,000 mark.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1866774172468236351?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading volume patterns indicate growing institutional interest in Ethereum. Professional traders appear to be using the recent consolidation phase as an opportunity to accumulate ETH at what they consider attractive price levels below $4,000.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Van de Poppe identifies several key price zones that could determine ETH&#8217;s trajectory in the coming months. The immediate resistance band lies between $3,830 and $4,274, with potential targets at $4,096 and $4,500 if these levels are breached decisively.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The current market structure suggests a continuation of the upward trend, provided<a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/"> ETH</a> maintains support above $3,505. This level represents a crucial floor that bulls must defend to preserve the positive momentum.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent price action shows ETH finding steady support during dips, indicating healthy market dynamics. Buyers have consistently stepped in to absorb selling pressure, preventing any sustained moves below key support levels.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Looking at broader market indicators, Ethereum&#8217;s network metrics continue to show robust activity. Transaction volumes and active addresses remain elevated, supporting the case for sustained price appreciation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Van de Poppe&#8217;s analysis suggests the current consolidation phase could set up ETH for an extended bull run lasting into 2025. This projection assumes the cryptocurrency can successfully break above the $3,800 resistance zone.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The analyst notes that while temporary pullbacks are normal within bull markets, the overall trend remains positive as long as ETH holds above $3,505. A break below this level could trigger a retreat toward $3,182.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market participants appear to be positioning for further upside, with derivatives data showing increasing long positions at current price levels. This accumulation pattern often precedes sustained price moves higher.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent trading sessions have seen ETH repeatedly testing the $3,800 resistance level, suggesting building pressure for a potential breakout. The repeated tests of this level without sharp rejections indicate growing buyer confidence.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Order book data reveals strong bid support has formed in the $3,700-$3,800 range, providing a cushion against potential downside moves. This price floor appears well-defended by buyers looking to accumulate positions.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The most recent price data shows ETH trading at $3,929.46, maintaining its position above key moving averages and technical support levels as market participants await a potential break above $4,000.</p>

<ul>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Ethereum tested $4,000 resistance level before experiencing a notable pullback to $3,621</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Binance&#8217;s taker buy-sell ratio turned negative, indicating increased retail selling pressure</li>

<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Total crypto market liquidations reached $1.58B, with ETH accounting for $234.72M</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Institutional ETF demand remains strong, helping offset retail selling pressure</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-battles-bearish-retail-sentiment-amid-surging-etf-demand/">Ethereum (ETH) has pulled back from the $4,000 resistance level, currently trading at $3,621</a>, marking a 6% decrease in the past 24 hours. The retreat comes as retail traders on Binance show increased selling pressure, while institutional interest through ETF products remains robust.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Data from cryptocurrency exchanges reveals a sharp decline in Ethereum&#8217;s market capitalization, which has dropped by over $40 billion from its recent peak. The total market cap fell from $490 billion last Friday to $434 billion at present, highlighting the scale of the current correction.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Despite the price decrease, Ethereum&#8217;s daily trading volume has shown an opposite trend. Volume has increased from $60 billion on December 6 to $72 billion currently, suggesting active market participation during the downturn. Market analysts attribute this volume surge primarily to selling activity.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/67578758494b0e68b488a3dd-Binance-ETH-investors-turned-bearish">CryptoQuant analyst</a> Darkfost reports that Binance&#8217;s taker buy-sell ratio for Ethereum turned negative as the price approached $4,000. This metric indicates that traders on the platform have largely adopted a selling stance, particularly since the beginning of November.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The market has witnessed substantial liquidations across the cryptocurrency space. According to Coinglass data, the past 24 hours saw 526,828 traders liquidated, with total liquidations reaching $1.58 billion. Ethereum-specific liquidations accounted for $234.72 million of this total.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Breaking down the ETH liquidations further, long positions made up the majority at $208.83 million, while short positions recorded losses of $25.89 million. These figures underscore the market&#8217;s current directional bias and the risks faced by leveraged traders.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading patterns on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, show retail traders have maintained their bearish stance throughout the recent price movement. This selling pressure has created consistent resistance around the $4,000 price level.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">However, institutional interest tells a different story. Demand for <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a> Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continues to show strength, providing a counterbalance to retail selling pressure. This institutional backing has helped maintain support levels despite the current correction.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The contrast between retail and institutional behavior highlights a divergence in market sentiment across different trader categories. While smaller traders appear to be taking profits, larger institutional players continue to accumulate positions through regulated investment products.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical indicators suggest the current price action represents a test of key support levels. The movement below $4,000 has triggered increased selling pressure, though some market participants view this as a healthy correction within a broader upward trend.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market data indicates that the selling pressure intensified after Ethereum failed to maintain momentum above the $3,900 level. This technical resistance point has become a focal point for traders monitoring price action.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The cryptocurrency&#8217;s price movement has prompted various responses from market participants. While some traders have closed positions, others view the current levels as potential entry points, particularly given the continued institutional interest.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Looking at order book data, significant support has formed around the $3,500 level, while resistance remains concentrated near the recent high of $4,000. These price points have become key areas of interest for market participants.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent data shows that exchange inflows and outflows have remained relatively balanced, suggesting that despite the price correction, there hasn&#8217;t been a mass exodus of ETH from trading platforms.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The market has recorded over $72 billion in daily trading volume, indicating active participation from both buyers and sellers. This elevated trading activity suggests high market engagement during the current price movement.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Cryptocurrency asset manager<a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/static.bitwiseinvestments.com/Research/Bitwise-The-Year-Ahead-10-Crypto-Predictions-for-2025.pdf"> Bitwise has released a comprehensive report</a> predicting record-breaking valuations for major digital assets by 2025, backed by data showing strong institutional adoption and regulatory developments in 2024.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitwise-forecast-bitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-poised-for-record-highs-in-2025/">The cryptocurrency market demonstrated robust growth in 2024, with Bitcoin reaching $104,000, marking a 141.72% increase year-to-date.</a> This surge coincided with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which accumulated $33.56 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Other cryptocurrencies showed similar upward momentum. Solana posted gains of 127.71%, while XRP experienced a 285.23% increase. Ethereum, despite lagging behind its peers, still achieved a 75.77% rise in value.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The cryptocurrency market&#8217;s strength extended beyond digital assets to crypto-related equities. MicroStrategy, a business intelligence company known for its Bitcoin holdings, saw its stock price surge by 525.39%. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also performed well, with its shares rising 97.57%.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">These gains outpaced traditional financial markets, with the S&amp;P 500 returning 28.07%, gold increasing by 27.65%, and bonds yielding 3.40% during the same period.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The regulatory landscape showed marked improvement throughout 2024. The success of crypto-friendly candidates in U.S. elections created a more favorable environment for the industry. President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign embraced cryptocurrencies, including plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The appointment of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary further reinforced positive sentiment, given his previous statements supporting cryptocurrency as a vehicle for freedom. These developments contributed to the market&#8217;s upward trajectory.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Looking ahead to 2025, Bitwise&#8217;s research team describes the period as the &#8220;Golden Age of Crypto.&#8221; Their optimistic outlook stems from increasing institutional adoption, technological advances in blockchain, and expected stimulus measures from major central banks.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The report specifically focuses on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which they term the &#8220;magnificent three.&#8221; These assets are expected to maintain their strong performance relative to traditional investments.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">For <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-bitcoin-casinos/">Bitcoin</a>, Bitwise projects potential prices of $200,000 to $500,000. This forecast considers continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the supply reduction from the April 2024 halving event. The proposed U.S. government strategic reserve of one million Bitcoins could further drive prices upward.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a> faced challenges in 2024 as investors focused on Bitcoin and faster networks. However, Bitwise expects a revival in 2025, projecting a new all-time high of $7,000. This outlook is based on growing activity on Layer 2 solutions like Base and Starknet, anticipated spot Ethereum ETF inflows, and increased stablecoin and tokenization projects.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-solana-casinos/">Solana&#8217;s</a> recovery from the 2022 market downturn impressed investors, with its 2024 surge partly driven by memecoin activity. Bitwise predicts continued ecosystem growth beyond memecoins, forecasting a new high of $750 per SOL.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The cryptocurrency market&#8217;s current state shows consolidation, with Bitcoin trading at $96,000, Ethereum at $3,662, and Solana at $218.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The April 2024 Bitcoin halving event remains a key factor in these projections, as it will reduce the rate of new Bitcoin creation and potentially increase scarcity in the market.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">These forecasts align with broader market trends showing increased institutional participation and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies through regulated investment vehicles.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ethereum&#8217;s price has reached a critical juncture as it tests the $4,000 resistance level, supported by increasing trading volume and on-chain activity. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-finally-set-for-a-new-all-time-high-heres-what-analysts-say/">The cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent price movement has drawn attention from market participants and analysts</a> who are closely monitoring technical indicators and market metrics.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Data from major cryptocurrency exchanges shows Ethereum trading at $3,847 as of the latest market update, representing a 3.9% decrease in the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term pullback, the cryptocurrency has maintained a position near the important $4,000 price level.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Over the past year, Ethereum has recorded a 62% increase in value, according to data from CoinGecko. This performance, while positive, has not matched the gains seen in some other digital assets during the same period, including Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market analyst Pentoshi recently highlighted the importance of <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum&#8217;s</a> structural changes in the market. Through social media platform X, Pentoshi pointed out that Ethereum has achieved its highest weekly close of the year, suggesting building momentum in the current market cycle.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has introduced a new dynamic to the market. These investment vehicles have consistently attracted substantial inflows, indicating growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical analysis from crypto analyst CryptoPoseidonn suggests multiple price targets based on Fibonacci extension levels. According to the analysis, these levels project potential prices of $6,000 at the 1.272 extension, $7,400 at the 1.618 extension, and $11,400 at the 2.618 extension.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading patterns on shorter timeframes have also caught the attention of market observers.

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On-chain metrics provide additional context to the price action. Data shows an increase in both active addresses and large-value transactions during the recent price rally, indicating broader market participation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The $4,000 price level represents a psychological barrier that has historically attracted increased trading activity. Market data shows concentrated order books around this price point, suggesting traders are positioning for potential price movement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading volume across major exchanges has shown an uptick as the price approaches this key level. This increased activity typically indicates heightened market interest and can precede price movement in either direction.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent market data reveals that spot trading volumes have risen across multiple exchanges. This metric often serves as an indicator of genuine market interest rather than leverage-driven price action.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical indicators on daily and weekly timeframes show building momentum. The weekly chart, in particular, displays a series of higher lows, a pattern often associated with sustained upward price movement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Order flow analysis indicates accumulation at current price levels. This pattern suggests market participants are building positions despite short-term price fluctuations.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market depth data shows improving liquidity conditions around current price levels. This metric is important for supporting stable price movement and reducing the impact of large trades.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The latest market data shows Ethereum&#8217;s price continuing to test the $4,000 level while maintaining support above $3,800, with active trading continuing across major exchanges.</p>

<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Large ETH transactions have increased by 300%, reaching $17.15 billion in volume</li>

<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Strong support zone exists between $3,514-$3,634 with 5.1 million tokens held</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-could-reach-new-all-time-high/">Ethereum continued its upward trajectory this week, reaching a new yearly high of $4,096, marking a crucial milestone in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s 2024 performance.</a> The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization pushed past its previous March peak by $3, demonstrating renewed market confidence.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Transaction data reveals a remarkable surge in network activity, with weekly volume increasing by more than 300%. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/large-ethereum-transactions-grow-as-eth-breaks-yearly-highs/">According to data from IntoTheBlock, large Ethereum transactions reached $17.15 billion yesterday,</a> indicating growing participation from institutional investors and wealthy market participants.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The surge in transaction volume coincides with increased buying pressure, as multiple large-scale purchases were recorded across major exchanges. This uptick in activity suggests a broader market interest in Ethereum beyond retail traders.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Price movements show strong support forming around the $3,560 level, where approximately 3.4 million addresses hold 5.1 million tokens. This concentration of holdings creates a substantial support zone between $3,514 and $3,634, potentially providing a safety net against major price corrections.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical analysis of current market conditions reveals minimal resistance between the current price level and Ethereum&#8217;s previous all-time high of $4,878. The only notable resistance appears around $4,540, where about 608,960 addresses collectively hold 668,980 ETH tokens.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market data indicates that Ethereum&#8217;s recent price action has maintained stability above the crucial $3,800 mark, with consistent trading volume supporting the upward movement. The sustained activity suggests organic growth rather than speculative trading.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The weekly close becomes particularly important for market sentiment, as closing above $4,000 would represent the highest weekly close since December 2021. This technical milestone could attract additional buyer interest and potentially catalyze further price appreciation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On-chain metrics show increased wallet activity, with new addresses joining the network at an accelerated rate. This growth in user adoption parallels the rise in transaction volumes, suggesting broader market participation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading patterns indicate a shift in market dynamics, with longer-term holders maintaining their positions while new buyers enter the market. This behavior typically precedes sustained price movements, as seen in previous market cycles.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The current price level of $3,960 represents a critical juncture for <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a>, sitting just below the psychological $4,000 barrier. Market observers note that maintaining prices above this threshold could establish a new support level for future price action.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent data shows that buy orders have consistently outpaced sell orders on major exchanges, creating upward pressure on prices. This imbalance between supply and demand contributes to the current price stability and upward trajectory.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Exchange flow metrics indicate a decrease in available supply on trading platforms, as more investors move their holdings to private wallets. This reduction in readily tradeable tokens typically correlates with decreased selling pressure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The percentage of Ethereum tokens held in smart contracts continues to rise, effectively reducing the circulating supply available for trading. This lock-up of tokens contributes to the overall market dynamics and potential price appreciation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Historical price data suggests that Ethereum&#8217;s current position mirrors previous accumulation phases that preceded major price movements. However, past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The latest market data shows Ethereum trading at $3,960, with 24-hour volume maintaining steady levels above industry averages. Price action remains contained within an upward channel, suggesting continued bullish momentum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has exploded atop the Ethereum blockchain this year. In doing so, the sector&#8217;s top apps, like trading protocols Uniswap and Curve, have never been more used <a href="https://blockonomi.com/uniswap-sees-revenues-surge-to-new-heights/">or popular</a>.</p>
<p>In recent months, this DeFi boom has been rapidly accelerated by the arrival of the new hit &#8220;yield farming&#8221; phenomenon. But what is yield farming, how does it work, and how can you participate?</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s post, we&#8217;ll be breaking down the ins and outs of yield farming for beginners so you can eventually start harvesting crypto on your own <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f468-200d-1f33e.png" alt="👨‍🌾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f69c.png" alt="🚜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>What Yield Farming Is</h2>
<p>DeFi apps are fledgling, and they need users to grow and actualize.</p>
<p>To this end, this year DeFi projects have been increasingly turning to yield farming. This process involves protocols distributing governance tokens to their users to bootstrap activity and incentivize the support of key early stakeholders.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the example of major DeFi borrowing and lending project Compound, which rolled out farming around its COMP governance token earlier this year. Compound distributed COMP retroactively to its past lenders and borrowers and offered ongoing COMP rewards to its current ones.</p>
<p>In other words, you could earn COMP &#8212; and thus a future say in Compound&#8217;s governance &#8212; just for using Compound. That&#8217;s yield farming in a nutshell.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What You’ll Need to Start Farming</h2>
<p>To start yield farming, your checklist is pretty simple. You&#8217;ll only need:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>An Ethereum address (ideally a hardware wallet)</em></li>
<li><em>Some ETH to pay for transactions</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s all! Once you have your wallet and ETH prepared, you&#8217;ll be ready to move on to analyzing and identifying which yield farming opportunities are right for you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Finding Farming Opportunities</h2>
<p>New yield farming campaigns are popping up everyday at this point. Figuring out which ones are worthwhile to participate in is half the battle.</p>
<p>The good news is that plenty of resources have recently popped up that make this process a lot easier. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Etherscan&#8217;s new <a href="https://etherscan.io/yieldfarms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Yield Farms</strong></a> page offers an unfiltered and extensive list of projects that have ongoing yield farming campaigns.</li>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://yieldfarming.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yieldfarming.info</a></strong> site provides a curated list of yield farming opportunities as well as detailed wallet-based stats, such as your estimated annual percentage yield (APY) and more</li>
<li>Crypto market data site Coingecko also has a new <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/yield-farming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Farms</strong></a> page that hosts top yield farming opportunities and provides tools like an APY calculator, an impermanent loss calculator, and more.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Keep in Mind APY + Gas Prices</h2>
<p>You won&#8217;t want to use or participate in a protocol for yield farming without having a general idea of what kind of APY you can expect for doing so. Some of the sites mentioned above are great for this. Here, a few other things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yield farming projects will show APY stats for their pools on their own sites. These can be deceptive or confusing at best, so don&#8217;t take these stats as the final word.</li>
<li>Pools with high APYs are high risk, high reward. Tread cautiously.</li>
<li>APYs shift over time, as yield farming campaigns typically have different distribution phases and so on. Be aware of how these distributions are set up and change (e.g. dwindling token rewards over a period of 4 weeks).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then another important consideration is gas. On Ethereum, users have to pay a fee, or &#8220;gas,&#8221; to have their transactions processed.</p>
<p>Since Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi arena is currently booming, demand for Ethereum blockspace has never been higher and gas prices have skyrocketed accordingly.</p>
<p>That said, it can be really expensive to enter and exit yield farming positions lately. Make sure you&#8217;re taking into account these gas costs as you try to figure out which opportunities are most feasible for you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Jumping Into Liquidity Pools</h2>
<p>Yield farming centers around liquidity pools. When you deposit crypto assets to these pools, you receive LP tokens (and thus the possible upside of earning a cut of the pool&#8217;s transaction fees) in return.</p>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s never been easier to provide liquidity to the hottest farming pools using DeFi dashboards like <a href="https://zapper.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapper.fi</a> or <a href="http://app.zerion.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zerion</a>. These services let you add your assets wherever you like and essentially with the click of a single button. Then, it&#8217;s time for staking.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43402" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-43402" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zapper.png" alt="" width="691" height="333" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zapper.png 1486w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zapper-300x145.png 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zapper-1024x493.png 1024w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zapper-768x370.png 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zapper-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43402" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Zapper.fi</figcaption></figure>
<hr />
<h2>Staking for Making</h2>
<p>Once you have your LP tokens for your farm of choice, you&#8217;ll want to go stake them in order to start farming your target project&#8217;s governance token. Let&#8217;s take Uniswap&#8217;s new UNI farming for example.</p>
<p>One of Uniswap&#8217;s first four UNI rewards pools is its ETH/DAI liquidity pool. Let&#8217;s say you hypothetically get your ETH/DAI LP tokens ready. Then you&#8217;d simply head over to Uniswap and follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the UNI tab</li>
<li>Click on the ETH/DAI Deposit button</li>
<li>Click on the Stake button</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_43405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43405" style="width: 449px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-43405" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uni.png" alt="" width="449" height="434" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uni.png 872w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uni-300x289.png 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uni-768x741.png 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uni-50x48.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43405" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Uniswap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Complete the transaction, and there you have it: you&#8217;ll start earning UNI automatically for as long as the farming campaign continues. Moreover, you can follow this same general process when it comes to participating in other farms, too.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Yield Farming for Beginners: yEarn Vaults</h2>
<p>yield aggregator protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/iearnfinance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yEarn</a> has become a major hit in DeFi because it automates yield farming and makes it simple. One of yEarn&#8217;s early stars have been its Vaults, which are DeFi products that let you automatically long the collateral you put in.</p>
<p>For example, consider yEarn&#8217;s yETH Vault. You deposit ETH into the Vault, and then the system starts doing its magic in leveraging that ETH. In doing so, you earn more returns in ETH all the while. It&#8217;s simple, straightforward, and you don&#8217;t have to do anything else besides depositing an asset into the Vault.</p>
<p>yEarn also offers a variety of Vaults, e.g. a yLINK Vault for those wanting to long Chainlink.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Prospects of Governance Tokens</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, yield farmers are farming <em>governance tokens</em>. These tokens can be dumped on the market for immediate gains, sure, but they also offer the chance for holders to own and collaborate on the very protocol&#8217;s they use going forward.</p>
<p>This is all quite new territory, not just within the cryptoeconomy but also the world. Governing these protocols is a huge ongoing experiment. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how farming and governance play into each other in the years ahead.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Bitcoiners Can Join In, Too</h2>
<p>Just because your portfolio is BTC heavy doesn&#8217;t mean you have to sit on the sidelines when it comes to yield farming.</p>
<p>In fact, the most popular farming pool in all of DeFi right now is Uniswap&#8217;s ETH/WBTC pool, which currently has over $400 million in <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/yield-farming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Value Locked</a> (VL) according to Coingecko. So here&#8217;s what you could think about doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Convert some of your BTC to WBTC</em></li>
<li><em>Deposit your WBTC into Uniswap&#8217;s ETH/WBTC pool</em></li>
<li><em>Farm UNI (and sell it for more BTC if you want!)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Beware Risks and Scams</h2>
<p>There are many risks around yield farming. First off, don&#8217;t go chasing every single yield farming opportunity in trying to find the next big thing. Scammers are popping back up to take advantage of the buzz.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the risk of bugs, hacks, and impermanent loss (which simply means you would&#8217;ve been better off holding your asset, e.g. ETH, rather than serving as an LP for it in a particular pool).</p>
<p>Once you have your head wrapped around these risks, the fields are yours for farming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>TLDR</h2>
<ul>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Ethereum showing strong upward momentum, trading above $3,770 and 100-hourly SMA</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Break above bearish trend line at $3,870 on hourly chart</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Price faces resistance near $3,890 level</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Major support established at $3,775</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Potential target of $4,000 if price breaks above $3,980 resistance</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-gears-up-4000/">Ethereum&#8217;s price is showing renewed strength in recent trading</a>, maintaining positions above the $3,770 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has established a solid foundation above the $3,670 support zone, indicating sustained buyer interest in the market.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The price action has demonstrated particular resilience in recent hours, with ETH forming a stable base before initiating a fresh increase above the $3,720 mark. This movement has outpaced Bitcoin&#8217;s performance in the same timeframe, suggesting independent strength in Ethereum&#8217;s market dynamics.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market data indicates that bulls have successfully pushed the price above the $3,780 resistance level, marking a clear break above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. This technical milestone represents the midpoint of the recent downward move from the $3,956 swing high to the $3,680 low.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Adding to the technical picture, traders have observed a break above a short-term bearish trend line, which had established resistance at $3,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. This development suggests a potential shift in short-term market structure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The current price action places <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a> in a position to test higher levels, though several resistance points remain ahead. The immediate challenge appears near the $3,890 level, coinciding with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Looking at the technical structure, the first major resistance zone has formed near the $3,950 level. Beyond this, traders are watching the $3,980 mark as a key barrier to overcome. A successful break above this level could open the path toward the psychologically important $4,000 mark.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The hourly MACD indicator shows increasing momentum in the bullish zone, providing additional technical confirmation of the current upward pressure. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) for ETH/USD has also moved above the 50 zone, suggesting growing buying pressure in the market.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">However, the market structure also reveals potential support levels should any downward pressure emerge. The first notable support appears near $3,820, with a more substantial support zone established around $3,775.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading volumes have remained steady during this price movement, indicating sustained market participation. The price action has maintained consistency above key moving averages, suggesting underlying strength in the current market structure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">If the upward momentum continues and Ethereum successfully breaks above the $4,000 resistance, technical analysis suggests potential targets at $4,050 and possibly extending to $4,120. These levels represent the next major technical barriers based on previous price action and chart patterns.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On the downside, market participants are watching several key support levels. A move below $3,775 could lead to a test of the $3,720 support. Further selling pressure might bring the $3,650 level into focus, with the next substantial support positioned at $3,620.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The market&#8217;s technical indicators currently paint a picture of controlled upward momentum. The price has maintained positions above key moving averages while respecting established support levels, suggesting orderly market behavior.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent trading patterns show increased buying pressure at key support levels, indicating active market participation from buyers when prices dip. This behavior has contributed to the overall stability of the upward price movement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The hourly chart patterns reveal a series of higher lows, typically considered a bullish market structure. This pattern has developed alongside the break above the previously mentioned bearish trend line.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Current price action places Ethereum near the upper range of recent trading activity, with the price maintaining positions above both the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average and key support levels.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The most recent data shows Ethereum trading near $3,870, having overcome several minor resistance levels in its move upward from the $3,650 support zone.</p>

<ul>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Ethereum is currently trading around $3,700, showing an 8% increase over the past week</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Technical analysis shows ETH moving in an Ascending Channel pattern over multiple years</li>

<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Price maintains stability above $3,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ethereum has maintained its upward trajectory,<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rockets-up-4000/"> reaching $3,700 in recent trading sessions, marking an 8% increase over the past week.</a> The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continues to show strength as it moves within an established ascending channel pattern.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market data from leading exchanges shows sustained buying pressure as Ethereum maintains its position above crucial support levels. Trading volume has seen a notable increase, particularly in the spot markets, indicating growing interest from both retail and institutional investors.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-10000-crypto-analyst-mid-long-term-eth/">Technical analysis reveals that Ethereum has been operating within an ascending parallel channel for an extended period.</a> This pattern, identified by analyst Ali Martinez, suggests a structured upward movement with clear support and resistance levels guiding the price action.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The lower boundary of this channel recently provided strong support, leading to a sharp price rebound. This technical bounce has reinforced the validity of the pattern and strengthened market confidence in the current upward trend.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Current market indicators show that Ethereum is trading well above its 100-hour Simple Moving Average, a technical indicator that often signals market sentiment. The presence of a bullish trend line has formed with support near the $3,800 mark, providing additional stability to the current price level.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading data indicates the formation of a strong support base at $3,300, which analysts identify as a potential buying opportunity should any short-term pullbacks occur. This support level aligns with previous resistance zones that have now turned into support, creating a solid foundation for future price movement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The hourly chart reveals multiple technical formations that support the bullish case. A key trend line has emerged, showing support at $3,800, while the MACD indicator displays growing momentum in the bullish zone, suggesting continued upward pressure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market order books show concentrated buying pressure at current levels, with sellers appearing to thin out above the $3,900 mark. This order book structure often precedes upward price movements when buying pressure overwhelms available selling supply.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Short-term price action indicates immediate resistance near $3,920, followed by a psychological barrier at $4,000. Breaking above these levels could trigger increased buying activity and potentially lead to testing higher resistance zones.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the hourly timeframe remains above the 50 mark, indicating healthy market conditions without showing signs of overextension. This technical indicator suggests room for additional upward movement before encountering overbought conditions.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading volume analysis shows increasing participation during upward price movements, while volume tends to decrease during minor pullbacks. This volume pattern typically confirms the strength of the ongoing trend.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Martinez&#8217;s analysis points to a mid-term target of $6,000, representing a 62% increase from current levels. The long-term outlook extends to $10,000, though this projection depends on maintaining the current channel structure and market conditions.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The current market structure shows strong support at multiple price levels, with $3,700 and $3,650 serving as key areas of buyer interest. These support zones have been tested and held during recent trading sessions.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ethereum&#8217;s recent price performance has drawn attention from market participants as the cryptocurrency posted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-recovery-3650/">43.88% gain over the past 30 days.</a> Data from various sources indicates multiple factors supporting this upward movement, including increased whale accumulation and declining exchange supplies.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The price of Ethereum currently trades above $3,600, maintaining support above the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. Recent price action shows the formation of a low at $3,557, from which the cryptocurrency has begun showing signs of recovery.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Exchange data reveals a notable trend in ETH supply movements. The amount of Ethereum held on exchanges has decreased to 12.6 million coins, dropping from a recent peak of 12.7 million observed between November 3 and November 18. This reduction in exchange supply often indicates a decrease in selling pressure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-whales-accumulate-caution-looms/">Whale activity has emerged as another key metric supporting the current market structure.</a> The number of addresses holding 1,000 or more ETH has increased to 5,580, reaching its highest level since October 13. This marks a substantial increase from the 5,535 addresses recorded on November 20.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical analysis reveals the formation of a bearish trend line with resistance near $3,650 on the hourly chart. The price has retraced approximately 50% of its recent downward movement from the $3,762 swing high to the $3,557 low.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market data shows that <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a> faces immediate resistance at the $3,685 level, which coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent price decline. Above this, the $3,750 level presents another crucial resistance zone.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On-chain metrics suggest a shift in holder behavior. The decrease in exchange balances indicates that more investors are moving their holdings to private wallets, typically associated with longer-term holding strategies rather than immediate selling intentions.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Price support levels have established themselves at various points. The first major support sits at $3,580, with additional support found at $3,550. Should these levels fail to hold, the next substantial support zone appears at $3,440.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The hourly price chart shows the formation of several technical patterns. A bearish trend line has emerged with resistance at $3,650, while the MACD indicator displays increasing momentum in the bullish zone.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading volumes have remained steady throughout this period, providing liquidity for the current price movements. The market has maintained orderly trading conditions despite the substantial monthly gains.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Short-term price action indicates potential resistance at $3,688 and $3,763. These levels may prove crucial for determining the next directional move. A break above these resistance points could open the path toward the $3,800 level.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the hourly timeframe currently positions itself above the 50 mark, suggesting moderate bullish momentum in the short term. This technical indicator aligns with the overall market structure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Recent price patterns show consolidation above the $3,600 support level. The market has maintained this level as a base for potential further upward movements, with buyers defending this zone during recent retests.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Looking at immediate price levels, Ethereum needs to clear the $3,650 resistance to continue its upward movement. A successful break above this level could lead to a test of the $3,685 resistance zone.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The latest data shows the price hovering near $3,620, as traders monitor key technical levels for signs of the next directional move. Trading volume remains consistent with recent averages, indicating steady market participation.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-bulls-charge-4k/">Ethereum&#8217;s price movement has shown renewed strength in recent trading sessions, pushing above the $3,700 mark</a> as buyers maintain control of the market. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has established a clear upward trajectory, breaking through several key resistance levels.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The price action began with a steady climb from the $3,550 support zone, demonstrating strong buying pressure that propelled ETH above multiple technical barriers. This movement mirrors the broader market momentum, with Bitcoin also showing similar upward trends.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Trading data from Kraken shows that Ethereum successfully breached the $3,450 and $3,550 resistance levels before continuing its ascent. The breakthrough came with notable trading volume, suggesting genuine buyer interest rather than temporary market dynamics.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The upward movement gained particular traction as <a href="https://moneycheck.com/best-ethereum-casinos/">ETH</a> crossed above the 100-hour Simple Moving Average, a technical indicator that traders often use to gauge market direction. This crossing has historically served as a reliable signal for continued price strength.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Market participants observed the formation of a bullish trend line, with support establishing itself around the $3,700 level. This technical pattern appears on the hourly chart, providing traders with a clear reference point for potential future price action.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The latest price surge reached a local high of $3,748, after which the market entered a consolidation phase. This consolidation period allows the market to digest recent gains and potentially establish a new base for future price movement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">During the minor retracement that followed the local high, the price found support at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This level corresponds to the upward wave that began at the $3,572 swing low and extended to the $3,748 high.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Looking at immediate resistance levels, traders identify $3,740 as the first hurdle that needs to be cleared. Beyond this point, the $3,750 zone represents a more substantial resistance area that could require increased buying pressure to overcome.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The $3,800 level looms as a major resistance point that could determine the next phase of price action. A decisive break above this level could open the path toward $3,880, with the psychological $4,000 level becoming a realistic target if momentum continues.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On the support side, the market structure shows multiple levels that could protect against potential downside movement. The immediate support sits at $3,700, followed by a stronger support zone near $3,675.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Technical indicators provide additional insight into market conditions. The MACD indicator, while still in the bullish zone, shows signs of decreasing momentum. This suggests that buyers may need to demonstrate renewed strength to maintain the upward trajectory.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the 50 mark on the hourly timeframe, indicating that buyers maintain control of the market despite recent consolidation. This technical reading aligns with the overall bullish market structure.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Should the price experience a pullback, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,640 could serve as a key support area. This level often acts as a final line of defense before deeper corrections occur.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The $3,570 level represents another important support zone, followed by the psychologically important $3,550 mark. These levels could become relevant if the market experiences a broader retracement.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Current trading patterns suggest that institutional and retail investors continue to maintain interest in Ethereum, as evidenced by sustained trading volumes across major exchanges. The price action remains supported by technical factors and market dynamics.</p>
